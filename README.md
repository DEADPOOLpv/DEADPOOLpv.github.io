Tetris
This repository contains a homebrew Tetris game.

About the Project:
This project is a tribute to the classic Tetris game, implemented for the Game Boy's limited hardware capabilities. It offers a faithful recreation of the core gameplay mechanics with a touch of nostalgia.

Features:

Classic Tetris gameplay: Rotate and place Tetriminos (falling blocks) to complete lines and score points.
Level system: Difficulty increases as you clear lines faster, with faster falling Tetriminos.
Scoring system: Points are awarded based on the number of lines cleared at once.
Game over: The game ends when Tetriminos reach the top of the playfield.

Controls:

Left and Right: move side to side

Down: Peices Falls Faster
R: Resets the Game

Additional Notes:

Feel free to modify the source code to customize various aspects of the game, such as difficulty levels, scoring system, or even add new features.
Consider including comments within the code to improve readability and maintainability.
