Tetris
This repository contains a homebrew Tetris game.

About the Project
This project is a tribute to the classic Tetris game, implemented for the Game Boy's limited hardware capabilities. It offers a faithful recreation of the core gameplay mechanics with a touch of nostalgia.

Features
Classic Tetris gameplay: Rotate and place Tetriminos (falling blocks) to complete lines and score points.
Level system: Difficulty increases as you clear lines faster, with faster falling Tetriminos.
Scoring system: Points are awarded based on the number of lines cleared at once.
Game over: The game ends when Tetriminos reach the top of the playfield.
